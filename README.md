## Overview

NFL Survivor Pools require you to pick one team to win each week, but you can only use each team once per season. This creates a complex optimization problem: which team should you pick this week to maximize your chances of surviving the entire season?

**Survivor AI** solves this with a multi-layered approach:
1. **Advanced ML Prediction Models** - Random Forest, Neural Networks, and XGBoost ensemble
2. **Hungarian Algorithm Optimization** - Optimal team-to-week assignment
3. **Real-Time Data Integration** - Live betting odds and consensus picks
4. **Pool Strategy Analysis** - Tailored recommendations based on pool size

## Key Features

### Machine Learning Prediction Models
- **Random Forest Regression** - High accuracy with feature importance analysis
- **Neural Network** - Deep learning for complex pattern recognition (highest research accuracy)
- **XGBoost** - Gradient boosting for robust predictions
- **Ensemble Methods** - Weighted combination of all models for superior performance

### Advanced Feature Engineering
- **Pythagorean Expectation** - NFL-optimized win probability (exponent 2.37)
- **Elo Rating System** - Dynamic team strength ratings
- **Offensive/Defensive Metrics** - Points per game, yards per play, efficiency ratings
- **Recent Form Analysis** - Momentum and trend tracking
- **Rest Advantage** - Scheduling factors and bye week considerations

### Optimization & Strategy
- **Hungarian Algorithm** - Optimal team-to-week assignment path
- **Pool Size Intelligence** - Contrarian vs. consensus strategy adjustment
- **Monte Carlo Simulation** - Variance analysis and risk assessment
- **Expected Value Calculation** - Pool dynamics consideration

### Data Integration
- **The Odds API** - Real-time moneylines and spreads
- **SurvivorGrid** - Consensus picks and future projections
- **Smart Caching** - Efficient data management
- **Multi-Source Blending** - Best of both worlds

### User Experience
- **Google Colab Notebook** - Zero-setup, browser-based automation (NEW!)
- **Interactive Streamlit UI** - Beautiful, responsive interface
- **Week-by-Week Selection** - Smart filtering and validation
- **Complete Season Paths** - Full week 1-18 optimal strategy
- **Visual Analytics** - Charts, metrics, and insights
- **Auto Season Detection** - Automatically detects current NFL week

### Automation & Deployment
- **Fully Automated Workflow** - One-click execution in Colab
- **Real-Time Updates** - Auto-detects current season and week
- **Cloud Ready** - Runs in Google Colab or local environment
- **Export Options** - CSV download for tracking
- **API Integration** - Seamless connection to data sources

## How It Works

### The Optimization Algorithm

The app uses the **Hungarian Algorithm** (linear sum assignment) to solve the assignment problem:
- **Goal**: Maximize the probability of winning out (surviving all remaining weeks)
- **Constraint**: Each team can only be used once
- **Method**: Convert to a cost minimization problem using `-log(win_probability)`
  - Minimizing the sum of `-log(p)` = Maximizing the product of probabilities
  - This finds the path with the highest overall win-out probability

### Data Sources

1. **The Odds API** - Current week moneylines (accurate, real-time betting odds)
2. **SurvivorGrid** - Future week projections and pick percentages (consensus data)

### Pool Size Strategy

- **Small pools (< 50)**: Favor higher win probabilities
- **Medium pools (50-200)**: Balance win probability with contrarian value
- **Large pools (200-1000)**: Emphasize contrarian picks to differentiate
- **Very large pools (> 1000)**: Heavy contrarian strategy required

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jlattanzi4/nfl-survivor-optimizer.git
cd nfl-survivor-optimizer
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a `.env` file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. (Optional) Add your Odds API key to `.env`:
   - Get a free API key at [The Odds API](https://the-odds-api.com/)
   - Add it to `.env`: `ODDS_API_KEY=your_key_here`
   - Free tier includes 500 requests/month

5. Run the app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Usage

1. **Configure Your Pool**: Enter pool size and current week in the sidebar
2. **Enter Previous Picks**: Select which teams you've already used each week
3. **Calculate**: Click "Calculate Optimal Picks" to see recommendations
4. **Review Options**: Explore the top 5 picks with complete season paths
5. **Make Your Decision**: Choose based on your risk tolerance and pool dynamics
