# Bug Fix: Feature Impact Analysis Chart Not Displaying Data

## Issue
The Feature Impact Analysis chart in the Streamlit app was displaying "No feature data available" instead of showing the actual feature contributions to the prediction.

## Root Cause
There was a column name mismatch between:
1. The data columns provided by `DataManager.get_comprehensive_data()` after enhancement with `integrate_all_data_sources()`
2. The feature names expected by the `get_enhanced_explanation()` function in `app.py`

### Data Column Names (Actual)
- `team_elo` - Team Elo rating
- `elo_win_probability` - Win probability based on Elo
- `spread` - Point spread (raw value)
- `recent_win_pct` - Recent winning percentage
- `recent_point_diff` - Recent point differential

### Feature Names (Expected by app.py - Before Fix)
- `elo_rating` 
- `pythagorean_win_prob`
- `spread_normalized`
- `home_advantage`
- `recent_form`
- `rest_advantage`

When the app tried to extract features using `row.get('elo_rating', 1500)`, it would always get the default value since the column `elo_rating` didn't exist. This resulted in all features having default values, which produced empty or minimal feature contributions.

## Solution
Updated the `get_enhanced_explanation()` function in `app.py` (lines 326-337) to:

1. **Map actual column names to expected feature names:**
   - `team_elo` → `elo_rating`
   - `elo_win_probability` → `pythagorean_win_prob`
   
2. **Calculate derived features:**
   - Normalize `spread` to `spread_normalized` (divide by 14)
   - Combine `recent_win_pct` and `recent_point_diff` into `recent_form`

3. **Handle missing columns gracefully:**
   - Check both new and old column names for compatibility
   - Provide sensible defaults when columns don't exist

## Code Changes
**File:** `app.py`
**Lines:** 326-359

```python
# Extract features
features = {}
if not team_data.empty:
    row = team_data.iloc[0]
    
    # Map actual data columns to expected feature names
    elo_rating = row.get('team_elo', row.get('elo_rating', 1500))
    pythagorean_win_prob = row.get('elo_win_probability', 
                                   row.get('pythagorean_win_prob', 0.5))
    
    # Normalize spread
    spread_raw = row.get('spread', 0)
    spread_normalized = spread_raw / 14.0 if pd.notna(spread_raw) else 0
    
    # Calculate recent form from components
    recent_win_pct = row.get('recent_win_pct', 0.5)
    recent_point_diff = row.get('recent_point_diff', 0)
    recent_form = (recent_win_pct - 0.5) * 2 + (recent_point_diff / 14.0)
    
    features = {
        'elo_rating': elo_rating,
        'pythagorean_win_prob': pythagorean_win_prob,
        'spread_normalized': spread_normalized,
        'home_advantage': row.get('home_advantage', 0),
        'recent_form': recent_form,
        'rest_advantage': row.get('rest_advantage', 0)
    }
```

## Testing
Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_feature_impact_chart.py` that validates:

1. ✅ Enhanced data has required columns
2. ✅ Feature extraction works with correct column names
3. ✅ Feature contributions are properly generated
4. ✅ Feature Impact Analysis chart can be created with data
5. ✅ Solution works for multiple teams

All tests pass successfully.

## Result
The Feature Impact Analysis chart now properly displays:
- Elo Rating contribution
- Point Spread contribution
- Recent Form contribution
- Pythagorean Expectation contribution

Each feature shows its impact on the prediction (positive or negative) with the correct values extracted from the enhanced data.

## Security
✅ CodeQL security scan completed with no alerts.

## Impact
- **User-facing:** Feature Impact Analysis chart now displays meaningful data
- **No breaking changes:** Solution maintains backward compatibility
- **Performance:** No performance impact
- **Reliability:** More robust feature extraction with fallbacks
