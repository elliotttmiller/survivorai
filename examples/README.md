# Survivor AI - Examples

This directory contains example scripts demonstrating various features of Survivor AI.

## Available Examples

### injury_analysis_example.py

Comprehensive examples of the injury analysis system (v3.0).

**Run the example:**
```bash
python examples/injury_analysis_example.py
```

**What you'll learn:**
1. Basic injury impact analysis
2. Win probability adjustments based on injuries
3. Game data enrichment with injury features
4. ML feature engineering integration
5. Position impact weights and calculations

**Topics Covered:**
- Position-based impact scoring (QB=1.0, RB=0.35, etc.)
- Injury severity classification (OUT, DOUBTFUL, QUESTIONABLE)
- Win probability adjustments (Â±15% max)
- Critical injury identification
- Integration with ML prediction pipeline

## Running Examples

All examples can be run from the repository root:

```bash
# Run from repository root
cd /path/to/survivorai
python examples/injury_analysis_example.py
```

## Example Output

The injury analysis example produces detailed output showing:
- Impact scores for different injury scenarios
- Win probability adjustments
- Feature integration with ML models
- Position weight explanations

Expected runtime: < 1 second
