- **Pick Popularity** - What % of pools are picking this team
- **Complete Season Path** - Week-by-week picks through Week 18

### Additional Analysis

- **Monte Carlo Simulation** - 10,000 scenarios, confidence intervals
- **Week-by-Week Survival** - Survival rates for each week
- **Risk Assessment** - Variance and confidence metrics
- **Strategy Guidance** - Tailored to your pool size

---

## üîß Configuration

### Data Sources

The notebook uses multiple data sources:

1. **The Odds API** (if key provided)
   - Real-time betting odds
   - Most accurate for current week
   - Updated hourly

2. **SurvivorGrid** (always used)
   - Consensus picks
   - Future week projections
   - Pick percentages

3. **ML Models** (always used)
   - Ensemble predictions
   - Feature engineering
   - 70% ML + 30% market blend

### Auto-Detection

The system automatically detects:
- **Current Season** - Based on today's date
- **Current Week** - Calculated from season start
- **Available Teams** - Based on your previous picks

---

## üîÑ Weekly Workflow

### Every Week

1. **Open the Notebook** - Same notebook, fresh data
2. **Run All Cells** - Auto-detects new week
3. **Add New Pick** - Include your latest pick
4. **Get Recommendations** - Fresh analysis

### Season Management

- Week detection is automatic
- No manual configuration needed
- System updates with real-time data

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "Runtime disconnected"

**Solution**: Reconnect runtime and run all cells again. Your code is saved.

### "No data retrieved"

**Causes**:
- No API key provided (expected)
- SurvivorGrid temporarily unavailable
- Rate limit exceeded (free tier: 500/month)

**Solution**: System uses ML predictions and fallback data automatically.

### "Module not found"

**Solution**: Re-run the installation cell. Dependencies are required.

### Slow Performance

**Tips**:
- First run is slower (setup)
- Cached data speeds up subsequent runs
- GPU not required (CPU is fine)

---

## üí° Tips for Best Results

### API Key

- Get free key for best results
- Monitor usage (500 requests/month free)
- Key only needed weekly (not daily)

### Pool Size

- Be accurate with pool size
- Strategy changes based on size:
  - Small (<50): Safety-first
  - Medium (50-200): Balanced
  - Large (200+): Contrarian

### Previous Picks

- Enter exact team names
- One team per line
- Order matters (chronological)

### Recommendations

- Review all 5 options
- Consider risk tolerance
- Factor in pool dynamics
- Don't always pick #1 (sometimes #2 or #3 is better)
