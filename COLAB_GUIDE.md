---

## üéØ How to Use

### First-Time Setup (5 minutes)

#### Step 1: Configure API Key (Optional but Recommended)

1. Visit [The Odds API](https://the-odds-api.com/) and sign up
2. Copy your API key
3. In Colab, click the üîë icon in the left sidebar
4. Click "Add new secret"
5. Name: `ODDS_API_KEY`
6. Value: Paste your API key
7. Enable "Notebook access"

This only needs to be done once - the key persists across sessions!

#### Step 2: Configure Pool Size

1. Run the **first cell** (Configuration section)
2. Enter your pool size (e.g., `150`)
3. The system automatically determines optimal strategy based on size:
   - Small (< 50): Conservative approach
   - Medium (50-200): Balanced strategy
   - Large (200-1000): Contrarian picks
   - Very Large (> 1000): Highly contrarian

Configuration is saved and persists between runs!

#### Step 3: Run All Cells

Click `Runtime` ‚Üí `Run all` in the Colab menu.

The notebook will automatically:
1. Clone/update the Survivor AI repository
2. Install dependencies (~2-3 minutes first time, cached thereafter)
3. Set up the environment
4. Load your API key from secrets (if configured)
5. Detect current NFL season and week
6. Fetch real-time data
7. Load your used teams
8. Run optimization
9. Display recommendations

#### Step 4: Manage Used Teams

**Option A: File-based (Recommended)**
1. Open file browser (üìÅ icon in left sidebar)
2. Navigate to `/content/survivorai/used_teams.json`
3. Edit the file to add teams as you use them
4. Format: `"used_teams": ["Team Name 1", "Team Name 2"]`

**Option B: Interactive Cell**
- Use the "Weekly Update Helper" cell (Section 8)
- Enter team name when prompted
- File updates automatically

### Weekly Workflow (< 30 seconds)

1. **Open Notebook**: Click the Colab link or open from saved notebooks
2. **Run All**: `Runtime` ‚Üí `Run all` (auto-detects current week)
3. **Review**: Check recommendations in results section
4. **Decide**: Choose your pick based on analysis
5. **Update**: Add team to `used_teams.json` or use update cell
6. **Export** (Optional): Download CSV for your records

No need to reconfigure - your pool size and API key are remembered!

## üîÑ Advanced Usage

### Changing Pool Size

If your pool size changes mid-season:
1. Edit the first cell (Configuration section)
2. Update the `pool_size` parameter
3. Re-run all cells
4. New strategy will be applied automatically

### Managing Multiple Pools

For multiple survivor pools:
1. Create separate used_teams files: `used_teams_pool1.json`, etc.
2. Edit the `user_input` cell to load the appropriate file
3. Run optimization separately for each pool
4. Compare recommendations across pools

### Custom Team Constraints

To exclude teams temporarily (injuries, bye weeks, etc.):
1. Add them to `used_teams.json` for this week
2. Remove after the week passes
3. Or manually filter results

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "Runtime disconnected"

**Solution**: Reconnect runtime and run all cells again. Your code is saved.

### "No data retrieved"

**Causes**:
- No API key provided (works without it using ML models)
- SurvivorGrid temporarily unavailable (fallback data used)
- Rate limit exceeded (free tier: 500 requests/month)

**Solution**: System automatically uses ML predictions and cached data.

### "Module not found"

**Solution**: Re-run the installation cell (Section 2). Dependencies are required.

### Slow Performance

**Tips**:
- First run is slower (3-5 minutes for setup)
- Subsequent runs use cached data (15-30 seconds)
- GPU not required (CPU is sufficient)
- Clear runtime if it becomes sluggish: `Runtime` ‚Üí `Restart runtime`

### Used Teams Not Loading

**Solution**:
1. Check file path: `/content/survivorai/used_teams.json`
2. Verify JSON format is valid
3. Use the interactive update cell as backup
4. File is recreated if missing

## üí° Tips for Best Results

### API Key Management

- Get free key from The Odds API for best accuracy
- Monitor usage (500 requests/month on free tier)
- Key only needed once per week
- Store in Colab secrets for security and convenience

### Pool Size Configuration

- Be accurate with your pool size
- Strategy automatically adjusts:
  - **Small (< 50)**: Conservative, high win probability
  - **Medium (50-200)**: Balanced approach
  - **Large (200-1000)**: Contrarian picks for differentiation
  - **Very Large (> 1000)**: Highly contrarian strategy

### Team Name Format

- Use exact NFL team names (e.g., "Kansas City Chiefs")
- Full names, not abbreviations
- Consistent spelling matters
- System validates against NFL teams list

### Making Your Decision

- Review all 5 recommendations, not just #1
- Consider your risk tolerance
- Factor in pool dynamics and competition
- Sometimes #2 or #3 is strategically better
- Balance win probability with pick percentage

## ‚ö° Advanced Usage

### Custom Configuration

Edit parameters in cells for fine-tuning:

```python
# In configuration cell
pool_size = 250  # Your actual pool size

# In API config cell
os.environ['CACHE_EXPIRY_HOURS'] = '12'  # Longer cache period
```

### Scenario Analysis

Test different strategies:
1. Run with current used teams
2. Compare with alternative past picks
3. Evaluate "what if" scenarios
4. Test different pool sizes

### Export and Tracking

Maintain records across weeks:
- Export CSV each week
- Track actual vs predicted results

### Strategic Principles

1. **Weekly Discipline**: Run analysis every week before games
2. **Risk Management**: Balance safety with differentiation
3. **Pool Awareness**: Monitor popular picks in your pool
4. **Long-Term Focus**: Optimize for full season, not just current week
5. **Backup Plans**: Always review multiple options

### Common Strategies

**Conservative (Small Pools)**
- Prioritize high win probability
- Save strong teams for later
- Avoid upset picks early
- Build confidence first

**Balanced (Medium Pools)**
- Mix safety with value
- Time contrarian picks strategically
- Monitor consensus picks
- Adjust week-to-week

**Contrarian (Large Pools)**
- Differentiate early and often
- Target low-owned quality teams
- Accept higher short-term risk
- Survive, then compete
