"""
Injury report data collection and analysis for NFL teams.

ENHANCED v3.5 with Web Scraping and Advanced Analytics

Integrates injury reports to enhance prediction accuracy by factoring in
the impact of key player injuries on team performance.

Data Sources:
- ESPN NFL Injury Reports (web scraping)
- CBS Sports NFL Injury Reports (web scraping)
- NFL Official Injury Reports (when available)
- Cached data with automatic refresh

Impact Analysis:
- Research-based position-specific WAR (Wins Above Replacement) adjustments
- Advanced injury type classification (not just severity)
- Historical recovery time analysis
- Position-specific injury impact multipliers
- Team depth and backup quality considerations
- Injury type severity (ACL, Concussion, Hamstring, etc.)

Research Foundation:
- NFL Digital Athlete ML models (NFL/AWS)
- PFF WAR methodology for player valuation
- Academic research on position-specific injury impact
- FiveThirtyEight Elo injury adjustments
- Football Outsiders DVOA injury analysis
