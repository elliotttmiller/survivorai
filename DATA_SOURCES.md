## Fallback Mechanisms

The system includes intelligent fallbacks for reliability:

### Schedule-Based Projections
- Activated when primary sources unavailable
- Uses team strength ratings
- Applies home field advantage (3 points)
- Generates complete season projections
- Ensures system always has data

### Data Quality Checks
- Validates probability ranges (5-95%)
- Checks for missing data
- Detects stale data
- Auto-refreshes when needed

## Troubleshooting

### No data from The Odds API
```

4. System will fallback to other sources automatically
```

### Low accuracy warnings
```
1. Enable The Odds API (biggest impact)
2. Ensure advanced metrics are enabled
3. Check that historical data is loading
4. Verify week detection is correct
```

### Slow performance
```
1. Disable ML predictions if not needed
2. Reduce historical data range
3. Clear cache directory
4. Check internet connection speed
```
