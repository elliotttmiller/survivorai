## Tips

1. **Keep it Updated**: Update this file immediately after making each week's selection
2. **Backup Your Data**: Consider keeping a backup copy of this file
3. **Verify Names**: Double-check team names match the official list above
4. **Sequential Weeks**: While not required, keeping weeks in numerical order helps readability

## Troubleshooting

### "Team not found" Error
- Verify the team name exactly matches the official list
- Check for typos or extra spaces
- Ensure proper capitalization

### "Invalid JSON" Error
- Ensure all strings are in double quotes, not single quotes
- Verify commas between entries (but not after the last entry)
- Check that braces `{}` are properly matched
- Use a JSON validator: https://jsonlint.com/

### File Not Loading
- Ensure the file is named exactly `used_teams.json`
- Verify it's in the correct directory: `/content/survivorai/`
- Check file permissions (should be readable)

## Integration with Notebook

The notebook automatically:
1. Checks for the existence of `used_teams.json`
2. Loads and parses the JSON data
3. Displays your previous picks in a formatted table
4. Uses this data to exclude teams from recommendations
5. Creates a default file with sample data if none exists

## Security Note

This file contains no sensitive information - it's just a list of team names and week numbers. It's safe to:
- Commit to version control
- Share with others
- Store in public repositories
