## Implementation Overview

### What Was Built

**3 New Production Modules:**
1. `data_collection/injury_reports.py` - Core injury analysis engine
2. `tests/test_injury_analysis.py` - Comprehensive test suite
3. `examples/injury_analysis_example.py` - Complete usage examples

**Enhanced Existing Modules:**
- `ml_models/feature_engineering.py` - Integrated 5 new injury features

**Complete Documentation:**
- `INJURY_ANALYSIS.md` - 584 lines of technical documentation
- Updated: README.md, FEATURES.md, DATA_SOURCES.md, ARCHITECTURE.md

### Technical Specifications

**Position Impact Weights:**
```
QB:  1.00 (100%)  - Touches ball every play
OL:  0.40 (40%)   - Protects QB, enables run game
RB:  0.35 (35%)   - Key offensive weapon
DL:  0.35 (35%)   - Pass rush and run defense
WR:  0.30 (30%)   - Important but replaceable
LB:  0.30 (30%)   - Defensive versatility
DB:  0.28 (28%)   - Coverage responsibilities
TE:  0.25 (25%)   - Dual threat, limited snaps
K:   0.10 (10%)   - Minimal overall impact
P:   0.05 (5%)    - Very limited impact
```

**Injury Severity Weights:**
```
OUT:          1.00 (100%) - Definitely not playing
DOUBTFUL:     0.85 (85%)  - Very unlikely to play
QUESTIONABLE: 0.40 (40%)  - 50/50 chance
DAY_TO_DAY:   0.20 (20%)  - Minor concern
PROBABLE:     0.15 (15%)  - Likely to play but limited
```

**Impact Calculation Algorithm:**
```python
# Step 1: Calculate individual impacts
individual_impact = position_weight × severity_weight

# Step 2: Aggregate with diminishing returns
total_raw_impact = sum(individual_impacts)
normalized_impact = 1 - exp(-1.5 × total_raw_impact)

# Step 3: Cap at maximum
final_impact = min(normalized_impact, 0.60)  # 60% max
```

**Win Probability Adjustment:**
```python
# Calculate net advantage
net_advantage = opponent_injury_impact - team_injury_impact

# Apply adjustment (max ±15%)
adjustment = net_advantage × 0.15

# Adjust and bound
adjusted_prob = clamp(base_prob + adjustment, 0.05, 0.95)
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Impact Analysis

```python
from data_collection.injury_reports import InjuryImpactAnalyzer

analyzer = InjuryImpactAnalyzer()
injuries = [
    {'player_name': 'Patrick Mahomes', 'position': 'QB', 'status': 'OUT'}
]
impact = analyzer.calculate_team_injury_impact(injuries)
print(f"Team impact: {impact:.1%}")  # Output: Team impact: 60.0%
```

### Win Probability Adjustment

```python
from data_collection.injury_reports import calculate_injury_adjusted_win_probability

base_prob = 0.65
team_impact = 0.60  # QB out
opponent_impact = 0.0  # Healthy

adjusted = calculate_injury_adjusted_win_probability(
    base_prob, team_impact, opponent_impact
)
print(f"{base_prob:.1%} → {adjusted:.1%}")  # Output: 65.0% → 56.0%
```

### ML Feature Integration

```python
from ml_models.feature_engineering import NFLFeatureEngineer

engineer = NFLFeatureEngineer(use_injury_data=True)
features = engineer.extract_comprehensive_features(
    team='Kansas City Chiefs',
    opponent='Buffalo Bills',
    week=7,
    season=2025,
    is_home=True
)
print(f"Total features: {len(features)}")  # Output: Total features: 56
```
