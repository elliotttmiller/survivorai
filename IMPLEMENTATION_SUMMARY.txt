- High (40-60%): Clear advantage indicated
- Moderate (25-40%): Some advantages present
- Low (10-25%): Close matchup, slight edge
- Very Low (<10%): Toss-up game, minimal edge

Based on: Distance from 50-50 probability

================================================================================
RISK ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

4-Tier Risk Levels:
- Low (<0.2): Strong pick, minimal concerns
- Moderate (0.2-0.4): Good pick, some risk factors
- Elevated (0.4-0.6): Uncertain outcome, caution advised
- High (>0.6): High-risk pick, consider alternatives

Risk Factors Identified:
- Close spread (<3 points)
- Coin flip probability (45-55%)
- Recent team struggles
- Underdog selection
- High uncertainty

================================================================================
ENSEMBLE MODEL BREAKDOWN
================================================================================

Shows 5 AI Models:
1. Random Forest - Robust, interpretable
2. Neural Network - Complex pattern recognition
3. XGBoost - Fast gradient boosting
4. LightGBM - Efficient, accurate
5. CatBoost - Best categorical handling

Consensus Analysis:
- Strong Agreement (<15% disagreement): High certainty
- Moderate Agreement (15-30%): Some variation
- High Disagreement (>30%): Significant uncertainty

Each model shows:
- Win probability percentage
- Deviation from ensemble average
- Agreement indicator (‚úì agrees, ‚úó outlier)
