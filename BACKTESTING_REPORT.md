## Performance Benchmarks

### Training Speed Comparison

| Configuration | Time | Relative Speed |
|---------------|------|----------------|
| Original (RF + NN + XGB) | 0.28s | 1.00x |
| Enhanced (+ LGBM + CatBoost) | 0.45s | 1.61x |
| LightGBM only | 0.03s | 0.11x ⚡ |

**Analysis**: 
- Enhanced ensemble is 1.6x slower due to training 5 models vs 3
- However, LightGBM alone is 10x faster than original ensemble
- For production, can use LightGBM-only mode for speed-critical applications

### Prediction Speed

All models maintain sub-second prediction time:
- Individual model: <0.01s
- Full ensemble: <0.05s
- Suitable for real-time applications

### Memory Usage

Reasonable memory footprint:
- Models stored on disk: ~5-10MB per model
- Runtime memory: <100MB for ensemble
- Scalable to thousands of predictions
